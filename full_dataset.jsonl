{"text": "madagascar's and indonesia's cultivations produce two-thirds of the world's supply of vanilla."}
{"text": "vanilla is the second-most expensive spice after saffron because growing the vanilla seed pods is labor-intensive."}
{"text": "nevertheless, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume production, and aromatherapy."}
{"text": "a vending machine is an automated machine that provides items such as snacks, beverages, cigarettes and lottery tickets to consumers after cash, a credit card, or a specially designed card is inserted into the machine."}
{"text": "the first modern vending machines were developed in england in the early 1880s and dispensed postcards."}
{"text": "vending machines exist in many countries and, in more recent times, specialized vending machines that provide less common products compared to traditional vending machine items have been created."}

{"text": "they consist of a sandwich of vanilla flavored outer crust filled with vanilla cream flavored filling."}
{"text": "akin to an oreo, the surface is textured and embossed with the product name, but vienna fingers have a round-ended 'finger' shape."}
{"text": "they come in a red and yellow accented rectangular package with the words \"vienna fingers\" in white lettering."}
{"text": "nabisco's cameo is similar."}
{"text": "the viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate."}
{"text": "for liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of \"thickness\": for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water.viscosity can be conceptualized as quantifying the internal frictional force that arises between adjacent layers of fluid that are in relative motion."}
{"text": "for instance, when a viscous fluid is forced through a tube, it flows more quickly near the tube's axis than near its walls."}
{"text": "in such a case, experiments show that some stress (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube) is needed to sustain the flow through the tube."}
{"text": "this is because a force is required to overcome the friction between the layers of the fluid which are in relative motion."}
{"text": "so for a tube with a constant rate of flow, the strength of the compensating force is proportional to the fluid's viscosity."}
{"text": "a fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid."}
{"text": "zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids."}
{"text": "otherwise, the second law of thermodynamics requires all fluids to have positive viscosity; such fluids are technically said to be viscous or viscid."}
{"text": "a fluid with a high viscosity, such as pitch, may appear to be a solid."}

{"text": "the company is scotland's biggest exporter of food and employs over 4,000 people in 15 locations."}
{"text": "walkers shortbread operates four factories in aberlour, where the company is also headquartered, and two in nearby elgin, scotland.the company's well-known shortbread is baked in the moray village of aberlour, following a recipe developed by joseph walker in 1898."}
{"text": "the whoopie pie (alternatively called a black moon, gob (term indigenous to the pittsburgh region), black-and-white, bob, or \"bfo\" for big fat oreo (also recorded as \"devil dogs\" and \"twins\" in 1835) is an american baked product that may be considered either a cookie, pie, sandwich, or cake."}
{"text": "it is made of two round mound-shaped pieces of usually chocolate cake, or sometimes pumpkin, gingerbread or other flavored cakes, with a sweet, creamy filling or frosting sandwiched between them."}
{"text": "\u015fekerpare is one of the popular desserts in the turkish cuisine."}
